Featuring all the same tech specs, the exclusive smartphones add the likes of Outlook to the usual suite of Office apps and OneDrive. Oddly enough, however, the phones also utilize Microsoft’s Cortana virtual assistant – this despite the fact that the Galaxy S8/S8+ launch is supposed to be the big rollout for Samsung’s own highly touted (and potentially superior) Bixby.

      <td>Samsung Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders Might Start on March 29 in Europe GO The phone could hit shelves on April 21 in South Korea Mar 24, 2017 08:06 Samsung is less than a week away from announcing its first flagship smartphone after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, and leaks about the Galaxy S8 continue to surface. Yesterday’s Target ad basically confirmed the phone’s design and hinted towards April 2 as the day when pre-orders would start in the US. A new report suggests that pre-orders for the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will go live in the Netherlands on the same day as the unveiling, which means March 29. Sadly, there’s no information as to when smartphones will be sent out to customers. Considering that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are said to hit shelves in Korea on April 21, this could be the same day when Samsung will start shipping out pre-orders in Europe. It’s worth noting that previous rumors pointed that pre-orders might start on April 7. Either way, the information will be provided during Samsung’s Unpacked event next week. No freebies for pre-orders in the Netherlands The same report mentions that Samsung won’t be offering any free products for pre-orders in the Netherlands. The phones will carry the price of €799 for the Galaxy S8 and €899 for the larger Galaxy S8+ with a 6.2-inch display. In the US, Target will offer a free Samsung Gear VR valued at $129.99 and a $100 gift card for every customer that pre-orders the Galaxy S8 and S8+ . Other retailers and carriers are expected to have similar offers. When it comes to its home country, Samsung intends to launch pre-orders on April 7 and also allow consumers to try out the two smartphones in 4,000 retail locations across the country. In addition, Samsung expects Galaxy S8 pre-orders to surpass the 400,000 pre-orders that the Galaxy Note 7 recorded during the 13-day period last year. There’s also word that Samsung could offer a three-month refund period for customers of the Galaxy S8 and S8+.</td>

      <td>The Samsung Galaxy S8 is one of the most beautiful phones money can buy right now. It’s sleek, has a stylish design and the “infinite display” with a bezel-less setup will wow you for days. But it’s not just a looker — it has plenty of features and functionality packed into its small frame, too. That’s not to say it’s perfect, though. No electronic or mobile device ever is or could be. ... Here’s what Samsung can do to improve and make the Galaxy S9, the S8’s inevitable successor, that much more amazing. DITCH THE DEDICATED BIXBY BUTTON OR ALLOW CUSTOMIZATION The Samsung Galaxy S8 comes with a dedicated Bixby button on the side. Bixby, if you don’t already know, is the brand’s AI voice assistant akin to Siri or Alexa. There’s just one major problem: At launch, the button — outside of South Korea — doesn’t actually open Bixby. ... IMPROVED FINGERPRINT SENSOR It’s likely that Samsung will remedy some of these problems in future firmware updates, but if they don’t, that’s a problem on its own. As it stands,the fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S8 is sluggish and unreliable. We can’t even begin to count how many times we’ve encountered an inaccurate reading because it happens consistently. Even the placement of the fingerprint sensor could be better. ... Quick Charge 4.0 is available right now, and Samsung could definitely be taking advantage of it. You see, charging also has to do with the integrated processor and must be supported by the foundation. The hardware to support the new standards exists and is inside the Galaxy S8. And yet, for whatever reason, Samsung is still using slower technology. SOLVE THEIR BATTERY PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL ... This time around, Samsung decided to be a little more modest and play it safe. And who can blame them? Naturally, that also means the battery in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are smaller than previous iterations, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they get less battery life. Thanks to a number of software and hardware improvements, there’s still a slight boost. Can it be done? ... Nobody knows just yet.

      <td>It comes with the latest connectivity options too, including 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, NFC, and a Snapdragon X16 LTE modem that makes the phone compatible with all US networks. However, a few items some people find essential are missing; there’s no microSD card support for storage expansion, no support for dual SIMs, and no 3.5mm headphone jack (it will come with an adapter). The 3040 mAh battery, essentially the same capacity as the Galaxy S8’s 3000 mAh pack, should be adequate for most people, but power users will likely find themselves using the Essential’s 27W quick charge feature. ... The dual-camera module around back contains a 13MP color sensor and a 13MP monochrome sensor, which captures about twice the amount of light as the color sensor without an RGB Bayer filter to block incoming photons. In addition to capturing better black-and-white images, the Essential also combines the luminance data from the black-and-white sensor with the color data from the other sensor, which should produce brighter color images with less noise and better contrast. ... I’m not sure Essential’s solution will be as flexible as Motorola’s in terms of the types of accessories that it will accommodate, but it’s the first system that does not appear to negatively impact the phone’s thickness, weight, or battery size. Around front there’s a nearly edge-to-edge display covered by Gorilla Glass 5. Like LG’s G6 and Samsung’s Galaxy S8, the Essential’s display is stretched vertically, resulting in a larger screen that keeps the frame narrow enough to comfortably hold with one hand. We’ve seen several OEMs move away from traditional 16:9 displays recently, but there’s still no consensus on what the optimal aspect ratio should be. The G6 (18:9), S8 (18.5:9), Xiaomi Mi MIX (17:9), and now Essential (19:10) are all slightly different, with the G6 and S8 opting for narrower screens.</td>

Now it seems that a fourth color option will soon be making its way stateside. A new image shared by @evleaks shows what are said to be US-bound versions of the Coral Blue Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. These devices look just like the other colors of GS8 and GS8+ that are currently available in the US, complete with “Samsung” and “Galaxy S8” or “Galaxy S8+” branding on their backsides, but they’re donning a Coral Blue hue that’s currently not available in the US.

      <td>Print By Kang Yoon-seung SEOUL, Samsung Electronics Co., which plans to showcase its new flagship smartphones next week, is going all out to come up with marketing strategies to best promote its cutting edge device, industry sources said Saturday. The South Korean tech giant, which suspended the production of the Galaxy Note 7 phablets last year due to battery problems that caused some of the devices to catch fire, plans to unveil the presumed Galaxy S8 next week in New York and London. The company is betting that the unveiling and the consumer reception will help it overcome the tainted image caused by the faulty phablets. Industry watchers expect the Galaxy S8 will boast top-notch technologies including an iris scanner and an artificial-intelligence program, along with other attractive features that can raise its user experience to the next level. Apparently taking the Galaxy Note 7 into consideration, industry sources said the Galaxy S8 will also come with a smaller yet "safer" battery capacity. Samsung, which released more teasers this week, plans to display the new smartphone at 4,000 locations throughout its home market starting April 1. This can generate considerable positive publicity for the flagship device. ... Independent smartphone retailers here also kicked off their own promotions with free gifts including laptops or plane tickets, as a rising number of South Koreans are keeping close eyes on the first flagship to be released from Samsung since the battery crisis. "We are being cautious since if we reveal our marketing strategies too early, other rivals may follow suit," an official at a local mobile carrier said. "The very few people who actually saw the Galaxy S8 in advance said the device has removed the home button at the bottom, and minimized the overall front bezel," another source said, claiming some would want to buy the new smartphone just for the design. "We expect demand for the device will be high from the start, and we are focusing efforts to secure enough supplies," the official added.

      <td>Brand-new iPhones cost a pretty penny as is, but it looks like the iPhone 8 may push that price even further thanks to its rumored improved 3D Touch functionality. The cost of 3D Touch modules for Apple's next iPhone are planned to go into production in the fourth quarter of 2017 - but could cost the tech giant over $15 (about £12, AU$20) to produce, according to industry sources at Digitimes. Up from the iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus' $9 (about £6, AU$12) module cost, the upgraded modules increase the part cost by nearly 67%. ... Some sources go as far as to estimate a quadruple-digit MSRP for the upcoming iPhone, though rumors that an iPhone 7S is also in the works suggests that Apple is considering a range of new handsets and not just a single super-premium one. Of course, all these features are still housed in the back room of The Rumor Mill, so it's best to take it all with a grain of salt. However, as more and more signs point to the iPhone 8 (or more likely, the iPhone X) arriving with a big ol' price tag, we suggest you start making routine visits the piggy bank, just in case.

      <td>The 8 most important features of Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 phone￼ Samsung may still be trying to make up for its debilitating hardware nightmare, but it has one distinct advantage it’s launching its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, early enough in the year that it gets to help establish a new standard for what a 2017 premium smartphone should be. One analyst even went as far as calling yesterday’s S8 event the launch of the “smartphone innovation Super Cycle.” If you believe that to be true, then that means the features of the new phone are some of the most innovative and important ones to date. Below are some of the key features of the Galaxy S8 phone that are likely to be the most talked-about, tested, and even copied over the next several months. We can’t say for sure whether these are the best features of the phone, because we haven’t had the chance to use it for an extended time period. But these are definitely the ones that make it stand out. Your move, Apple. INFINITY DISPLAY The Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch display crammed into what feels like a normal-sized phone, with a barely-there bezel. That alone is a feat of engineering, but the phone is also a thing of beauty to look at. It has a clean, unbranded face; a bright, fluid-looking display; and a mirror-like glass back. ... By the way, if you still want an actual phablet: there’s a version with a 6.2-inch display, too. FORCE TOUCH Okay, Samsung isn’t calling it “Force Touch”; that’s Apple’s jam. But this new Galaxy S8 phone does incorporate a similar mechanism into the bottom half of it, which means that when you press on the (now entirely virtual) home button, it gives haptic feedback in response. Also! This phone doesn’t have a physical home button. ... It’s too soon to tell whether this placement is ill-advised. BETTER SELFIE CAMERA Samsung was uncharacteristically... subdued when it came to the Galaxy S8’s photo-snapping capabilities, but that might be because the biggest change was made to the front-facing camera, not the rear camera. The selfie camera now captures 8-megapixel photos with an f/1.7 lens, and also has autofocus capabilities. In our brief tests of the front-facing camera, autofocus worked well and fast. ... That’s where Samsung’s DeX comes in, short for “Desktop Experience.” DeX is a plastic bowl-like stand with a USB-C prong, a couple of ports, and a fan. It supports the Galaxy S8 and effectively gives you a PC-like mobile desktop on a display. Some apps are even optimized for the experience; although, the only browser it runs right now is Samsung’s own “Internet” browser. Is this the Road Warrior dream finally realized? ... So I appreciate that a manufacturer like Samsung can try to move the needle forward in all kinds of ways (No more bezels! Face scanning! Bye, home button!), and yet still keep that little hole in the bottom of its phone. Okay, arguably, the fact that the phone supports Bluetooth 5 is more notable. But in my humble opinion, the 3.5mm headphone jack is still one of the most welcome features of the Galaxy S8. Well, that and... A NON-EXPLODING BATTERY (WE HOPE) It’s the elephant in the room: can Samsung recover from the Note 7?</td>

They often conflate these and it all becomes mumble jumble techno confusion. To further confuse this situation, there is talk by at least one source that says that the newest type of card "UFS 2.1" is accepted by the S8/S8+!! However, the UFS 2.1 card was announced last summer to great fanfare by Samsung and still not yet available. ... Unless, of course, that this source is wrong: ...

      <td>by Don Reisinger May 31, 2017, 5:36 AM Some folks are getting excited about the prospect of this year's iPhone 8 coming with high-end screen technology. But next year's iPhones might provide more opportunities to step into the next generation. Credit: Martin Hajek A report out of Korea's ET News this week says both Samsung Display and LG Display are ramping up production on OLED screens to accommodate what they believe will be heavy demand in the coming years. ... Despite its top competitor, Samsung, offering OLED for quite some time, Apple has stuck to LCD screens that don't deliver the same color saturation or perfect blacks as OLED. While Apple hasn't commented on why it's gone with LCD, market experts have speculated that iPhone demand is too high for manufacturers that are experiencing relatively low yield on the manufacturing line to keep up. MORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone However, OLED production has improved over the past year and Apple now believes it can deliver the technology in the rumored iPhone 8 this year. The other iPhones Apple is reportedly planning -- believed to be known as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus -- will still rely on LCD technology, according to several reports. The ET News report suggests Apple will finally go all-in on OLED next year, when yields will likely be higher and supply not so constrained. ... However, if Apple does offer an OLED-based iPhone this year, it could come with several other important features, including an all-new design that would see the screen entirely cover the iPhone's face. It might also come with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor baked directly into the display . Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone 8, iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus later this year. Debate rages on when it could hit store shelves, with some reports saying it's slated for a September release and others saying it won't be available until October or November.</td>

      <td>Secondly, it is worth pointing out that Samsung Electronics has been by far the biggest contributor to the Kospi index’s performance year-to-date. The company has a weighting of around 25 per cent in its home market, and it reported a strong set of quarterly earnings in April. While positive earnings revisions have been the biggest share price driver, sentiment towards the company has also benefited from the successful launch of the Galaxy S8 smartphone and continued positive actions to improve shareholder returns. For example, Samsung recently decided to cancel W49 trillion (£34 billion) of existing treasury shares, concentrating ownership rights in the remaining shares. South Korea’s equity market has historically traded at a discount to other Asian markets, partly due to geopolitical tensions with North Korea, but largely due to its reputation for poor corporate governance.</td>

      <td>The Samsung Galaxy S8 is one of the most beautiful phones money can buy right now. It’s sleek, has a stylish design and the “infinite display” with a bezel-less setup will wow you for days. But it’s not just a looker — it has plenty of features and functionality packed into its small frame, too. That’s not to say it’s perfect, though. No electronic or mobile device ever is or could be. ... Here’s what Samsung can do to improve and make the Galaxy S9, the S8’s inevitable successor, that much more amazing. DITCH THE DEDICATED BIXBY BUTTON OR ALLOW CUSTOMIZATION The Samsung Galaxy S8 comes with a dedicated Bixby button on the side. Bixby, if you don’t already know, is the brand’s AI voice assistant akin to Siri or Alexa. There’s just one major problem: At launch, the button — outside of South Korea — doesn’t actually open Bixby. ... IMPROVED FINGERPRINT SENSOR It’s likely that Samsung will remedy some of these problems in future firmware updates, but if they don’t, that’s a problem on its own. As it stands,the fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S8 is sluggish and unreliable. We can’t even begin to count how many times we’ve encountered an inaccurate reading because it happens consistently. Even the placement of the fingerprint sensor could be better. ... Quick Charge 4.0 is available right now, and Samsung could definitely be taking advantage of it. You see, charging also has to do with the integrated processor and must be supported by the foundation. The hardware to support the new standards exists and is inside the Galaxy S8. And yet, for whatever reason, Samsung is still using slower technology. SOLVE THEIR BATTERY PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL ... This time around, Samsung decided to be a little more modest and play it safe. And who can blame them? Naturally, that also means the battery in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are smaller than previous iterations, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they get less battery life. Thanks to a number of software and hardware improvements, there’s still a slight boost. Can it be done? ... Nobody knows just yet.

      <td>It comes with the latest connectivity options too, including 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, NFC, and a Snapdragon X16 LTE modem that makes the phone compatible with all US networks. However, a few items some people find essential are missing; there’s no microSD card support for storage expansion, no support for dual SIMs, and no 3.5mm headphone jack (it will come with an adapter). The 3040 mAh battery, essentially the same capacity as the Galaxy S8’s 3000 mAh pack, should be adequate for most people, but power users will likely find themselves using the Essential’s 27W quick charge feature. ... The dual-camera module around back contains a 13MP color sensor and a 13MP monochrome sensor, which captures about twice the amount of light as the color sensor without an RGB Bayer filter to block incoming photons. In addition to capturing better black-and-white images, the Essential also combines the luminance data from the black-and-white sensor with the color data from the other sensor, which should produce brighter color images with less noise and better contrast. ... I’m not sure Essential’s solution will be as flexible as Motorola’s in terms of the types of accessories that it will accommodate, but it’s the first system that does not appear to negatively impact the phone’s thickness, weight, or battery size. Around front there’s a nearly edge-to-edge display covered by Gorilla Glass 5. Like LG’s G6 and Samsung’s Galaxy S8, the Essential’s display is stretched vertically, resulting in a larger screen that keeps the frame narrow enough to comfortably hold with one hand. We’ve seen several OEMs move away from traditional 16:9 displays recently, but there’s still no consensus on what the optimal aspect ratio should be. The G6 (18:9), S8 (18.5:9), Xiaomi Mi MIX (17:9), and now Essential (19:10) are all slightly different, with the G6 and S8 opting for narrower screens.</td>

      <td>Say goodbye to the Galaxy's home button and hello to an infinity display. Samsung (SSNLF) unveiled the Galaxy S8 and S8+ at an event in New York on Wednesday. The new phone displays are bigger than the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and  they have curved screens that flow onto the sides. For the first time on a Samsung phone, the physical home button is  removed entirely. ... The recall wiped out billions of dollars of profits and hurt Samsung's brand. "The launch of the new device must be perfectly executed for Samsung to  gain innovation leadership and to gain market share in the high-end  smartphone segment," said Thomas Husson, vice president and principal  analyst at research and advisory firm Forrester. Samsung's Galaxy S8 will also be going up against the newest version of  the iPhone, which is due out later this year. Expectations are high for  the new phone, likely called the iPhone 8, partially because this year  is the 10th anniversary of the device. "Samsung only has a window of opportunity of several months before the  launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone," Husson said. "The launch of  Samsung's new flagship smartphone is thus key for the brand even though  it has managed to reduce its business dependency on smartphones,  contrary to Apple."</td>

      <td>Even die-hard iPhone fans have to admit that the AMOLED displays on other phones, particularly those from Samsung, look better than the LCD screens on iPhones. But if the rumors are true, iPhone fans may no longer need to concede bragging rights to other phone screens, as Apple is reportedly looking to use a form of OLED display on the next iPhone. Just prepare your wallet, because OLED isn’t cheap. But that’s just one of the rumors we’re hearing. Check out all the latest scuttlebutt surrounding Apple’s next iPhone. 1. There WILL be an S model of the iPhone 7.A Barclays report obtained by MacRumors said Apple would skip the S model this year, which has historically followed each new phone version. The report claimed Apple would instead jump directly from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8 — or possibly even call it iPhone 10, since 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone — this year. Now, however, it appears we should expect S models of the iPhone 7 coming later this year, with updates to the processor and a new red color option, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and the Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara, which are both highly reliable sources. 2. In addition to the new S models, Apple will sell a third “high-end” iPhone.A report from reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that Apple would release a “high-end” iPhone with a larger 5.8-inch screen, compared with the iPhone 7 Plus’s 5.5-inch screen. Many are calling this premium phone “the iPhone 8.” More recent reports claim the iPhone 8 will have a smaller 5.1- or 5.2-inch curved screen that will wrap around the edges of the device. It sounds like a similar design concept as the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. To add more uncertainty to the mix, 9to5Mac says it’ll have a 5.5-inch screen. So, it seems certain that Apple will release a new high-end iPhone model with some radical design tweaks, but no one can decide what size screen it’ll have. 3. Regardless of its display size, a growing number of analysts say the iPhone 8 actually won’t feature a curved screen after all. IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam told MacRumors in March that he anticipates “Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model,” which directly contradicted a previous report that said the high-end iPhone would feature a curved wraparound display. We’re inclined to believe the flat-screen rumor.</td>

      <td>The G6 is the one that will sell the most, so they've redefined flagship to mean that. So while LG held back on equipping the phone with the latest hardware, they've focused on usability. Many will think (a few of us here as well) that's just downplaying the fact that Samsung won't let anyone use the Snapdragon 835 before the Galaxy S8 comes out, but let's face it - LG's marketing team did have to maneuver around the issue somehow. As for the ultimate in specs, LG says we should look for them in the V-series from now on. How convenient it is that the V20 is due for a refresh in the fall, when the S8 will be in the rearview mirror. ... LG G6 press imagesWe're also still trying to figure out what to make of the 'value proposition' phrase LG used to describe the G6 when we were first introduced to it. The $700 price that's been floating around is very much flagship-grade, and in the classic, pre-redefinition (some word that is) sense of the term. But by the looks of it, the Galaxy S8 will be even pricier, and the Pixel and the iPhone already are too (some versions on some markets, at least) - so LG might have a point there. You can't, however, judge a product's value for money before establishing its real-world merits first. That's exactly what we intend to do on the following pages, starting with an overview of the hardware.</td>

However, if that change happens at all, it might not happen to all iPhone 7S models, so you might still be able to buy a new iPhone with a recognizable design too. Recent rumors state there will be an iPhone 7S, 7S Plus and a 7S Pro - although we'd expect that last one to be an iPhone 8.The new phones will have edge-to-edge displays, making them smaller with the same sized screens or the same dimensions but with a massive screen embedded. TechRadar’s take: A glass body is believable, though until we start seeing leaked images of the iPhone 7S it’s too early to be confident of. Whatever happens, we’d expect significant changes though, especially as the iPhone 7S’s launch will mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone.iPhone 7S camera and batteryHottest leaks:A single-lens cameraWireless chargingWe’re not expecting a huge change to the camera on the iPhone 7S, with just a single-lens rumored for the 7S, and a dual-lens for the iPhone 7S Plus.</td>

The folks over at iDeviceHelp found out a flaw which they have shown in their hands-on video about Samsung S8’s biometric system. In the video, it is shown that how easy it is to bypass Samsung Galaxy S8’s facial recognition simply by waving a photograph of the owner of the device. This video clearly shows how unsafe this facial recognition system is at this stage and not as secure as it must be. Anyone can take owner’s pic and use it as a proof of being the owner and bypass the facial recognition check. It is believed that the device is the demo is only in a testing stage and Samsung will Hopefully fix this bug before shipping it on April 21. However, we strongly believe that iris scanner and the fingerprint scanner will remain the most secure options to protect your device from an unauthorized usage. The security related questions are arising in the customers’ mind and there are only a few weeks left for the official release of Samsung Galaxy S8 &amp; S8+ when all those questions are gonna get answered. However, an inner resource from Samsung confirmed it that if someone has set up facial recognition as security, it may even get unlocked by the face of the person while sleeping or even with a photo. “For now, the facial recognition technology is only intended for fun,” that person concluded. ... For that, you still must use the fingerprint reader on that back.” The front-facing iris scanner can, however, be used for Samsung pay and unlocking the smartphone.

      <td>The Galaxy S8 has an awesome audio feature that leaves the iPhone 7 in the dust Sponsored by E-book Vault - Free E-book’s =&gt; Image: lili sams/mashable It’s great to see Samsung’s Galaxy S8 include a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (unlike some other phones). But the future of music listening is undoubtedly wireless, which is why it’s also great the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the first smartphones to include Bluetooth 5.0 with support for not one, but two pairs of wireless headphones or wireless speakers simultaneously. SEE ALSO: Samsung’s Galaxy S8 has a killer feature that nobody’s talking about Compared to Bluetooth 4.2, Bluetooth 5.0 has four times the range, two times the speed and eight times the broadcast message capacity, according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), the body that develops, licenses and helps set standards for the wireless protocol. All that increased bandwidth means more reliable and robust Bluetooth connections, because let’s be real, Bluetooth connections today are still spotty. Bluetooth 5.0’s potentially game-changing feature, at least as far as the Galaxy S8 is concerned, is the aforementioned support for two wireless headphone or wireless speaker connections. In days past, the only way for two people to listen to a song together was to share a pair of wired earbuds, with each person getting one earbud, or blast the song through a speaker (a far less intimate experience). With the S8 and two pairs of wireless headphones (or earbuds), you and a friend can listen to the same song without needing to share any physical hardware. Heck, you guys don’t even need to be in the same room or even near each other since Bluetooth 5.0 has a range of up to 800 feet. This could also be really useful for two people to wirelessly jump onto a single conference call from a single S8 phone.

      <td>When the Essential Phone was revealed yesterday, all eyes were on one particular design feature: a display that extended right to the top of the phone, with a small cutout for the camera. We asked whether Apple should take a similar approach with the iPhone 8, and the majority of readers were opposed. Just 22% of you thought it was a good idea, while a full 60% didn’t like it. But what we’ve seen since then is that Apple may indeed be planning a similar approach with the iPhone 8 … NordVPN\n\n\nRenders based on a claimed chassis design for the device show a broadly similar approach to the Essential Phone: a display with no full forehead bezel, but rather a cutout biting into the top of the display. Given the expected dual cameras for augmented reality applications, the cutout shown is wider than that for the Essential Phone – but that’s just a variation on the theme. So let’s compare the two. The images above show the Essential Phone left and the iPhone 8 render right.  Leaving aside the purely practical issue of the dual cameras requiring a wider cutout, how do you think the designs compare? For a fair comparison, you need to ignore the shaded section on the Essential Phone’s screen, as we’re concerned here with hardware rather than software design.</td>

This is how its going to look like. #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/U7sY9hqm5S There have been lots of rumors and supposed pictures circulating of the upcoming device, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. The fake photos Geskin posted — which were also shared by Spanish language tech site iPhoneros — were intriguing because they seemed to affirm some of the reports about the iPhone 8 while challenging others. iPhonerosLike the phone in the debunked photos, other supposed pictures of the upcoming device indicate it will have a vertically-oriented dual-lens camera. But most reports indicate the iPhone 8 will have thinner borders around its screen than the phone shown in the fake photos. Geskin's debunking of one leak and affirmations of another, goes to show how leaks and rumors never truly reveal the final details of any product before its announced. Even if someone obtained a photo of an iPhone 8 from a verifiable Apple employee, it ought to be treated skeptically until Apple actually unveils the real thing.

Analyst  Andy Hargreaves told clients to buy Alphabet shares with the money raised by selling some Apple stock. ... But Hargreaves also became the latest analyst to mention some supply constraints that may limit the number of some  new iPhone models that will be released for sale this year. "Recent supply checks  suggest iPhone 8 (OLED) may be delayed until October with limited  initial supply that ramps through F1Q. Consequently, we are shifting  iPhone units out of FY17 into FY18, which, along with an increase to our  iPhone 8 ASP estimate, drives our FY17 EPS estimate down to $8.86 and  our FY18 EPS estimate up to $10.53." Apple, Amazon, Netflix,  and Facebook are among the major technology shares up more than 30  percent this year. Google-parent Alphabet is up about 26 percent.</td>

      <td>Is it necessary to transfer data from old iPhone to iPhone 8? In my opinion, it's necessary. When you transfer important data from old iPhone to iPhone 8, you can adapt to iPhone 8 more quickly. In addition, you can view important data directly, just as you didn't have a new phone. For example, when we want to call a friend, we can check the contacts directly in the old iPhone. But when you use your new iPhone 8, you don't have any contacts stored in your phone. You'll eventually need to store contacts in your new iPhone 8. Then, directly transferring the contacts from the old iPhone to the new iPhone 8 will provide us with the convenience. However, the types of data in iPhone are many and messy, and how do you transfer these data uniformly and quickly? Such as contacts, photos, videos, music, etc. How do you transfer these data at once? ... Step 1.Download, install and run the MobileTrans  First of all, you need to download, install and run MobileTrans on your computer, then you can click "Phone to Phone Transfer" button when you see the main interface as follow. Step 2. Connect your iPhones to the computer  Get both of your old iPhone and iPhone 8 connected. So you should prepare two USB lines. The data will be transferred from the old iPhone to the iPhone 8. You can use the "Flip" button to exchange their position. Step 3. Start transferring data to iPhone 8  Next, check out the items you need to transfer between the two phones and click "Start Transfer". When the data is officially transferred, please do not interrupt the connection between the phone and the computer.

According to the subreddit’s moderators, the identities of the posters have been verified with proper documentation and evidence, but it’s not clear how trustworthy the information is - AppleInsider notes that there’s some basis to take this information with a grain of salt, and the mods noted that they’re only able to verify that the users in question would have access to this information. Here’s an overview of what they revealed, and we’ll see tomorrow how accurate it is. ... It’s not clear if Mirrorshades will go forward, however. Foxconninsider explained that while they were a “unique design”, there was a 65 percent chance that the entire project would be canceled, because the batteries are difficult to produce. iPhone 8 Foxconninsider referred to the overhauled iPhone as the iPhone X, and that production has been delayed, which is in line with some rumors that have surfaced recently. The user noted that some of the leaked designs weren’t accurate, and explained that the new version looked “more like an iPhone 7 with glass and without the AuthenTec's capacitive touch module.” When asked which leaked image it looked like the most, they said that the middle one was the most accurate.</td>

      <td>Apple shares downgraded to sector weight from overweight by technology-focused research firm Pacific Crest in a note Sunday. Analyst Andy Hargreaves believes the surging stock is not pricing in possible risks, such as supply issues with the new iPhone 8. Hargreaves, one of just five analysts with a hold rating, sees the stock lower by $10 a year from now. Apple shares were downgraded to sector weight from overweight by technology-focused research firm Pacific Crest in a note Sunday. ... But Hargreaves also became the latest analyst to mention some supply constraints that may limit the number of some new iPhone models that will be released for sale this year. "Recent supply checks suggest iPhone 8 (OLED) may be delayed until October with limited initial supply that ramps through F1Q. Consequently, we are shifting iPhone units out of FY17 into FY18, which, along with an increase to our iPhone 8 ASP estimate, drives our FY17 EPS estimate down to $8.86 and our FY18 EPS estimate up to $10.53." Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Facebook are among the major technology shares up more than 30 percent this year. Google-parent Alphabet is up about 26 percent.</td>

      <td>Render via Pierrick Pichaureaux/@le.pich\n\nApple hasn’t officially unveiled its iPhone 8 yet\nbut rumors for the phone to follow that one (iPhone 9) are already\nrunning wild. According to a report by The Investor, Samsung\nDisplay recently signed a deal with Apple to provide it OLED panels\nfor three new iPhones. Apple fans will remember the company\nordered tens of millions of OLED panels back in April. The OLED panels are one of the reasons why the new iPhone 8 is\nexpected to retail for upwards of $1,000 USD. With the iPhone 8 accounting for one of the three phones, the\nreport claims that the other two iPhones will be variants of the\niPhone 9, with 5.28-inch and 6.46-inch displays, making it the\nlargest iPhone ever. For comparative purposes, the iPhone 7 has a\n4.7-inch display and the iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch display. While no other information has been revealed, stay tuned as the\nrumor mill has started churning. You can take a look at the possible final iPhone 8\ndesign and wait patiently until the unveiling or take a\nlook at all the iPhone alternatives and switch sides.

      <td>Print By Kang Yoon-seung SEOUL, Samsung Electronics Co., which plans to showcase its new flagship smartphones next week, is going all out to come up with marketing strategies to best promote its cutting edge device, industry sources said Saturday. The South Korean tech giant, which suspended the production of the Galaxy Note 7 phablets last year due to battery problems that caused some of the devices to catch fire, plans to unveil the presumed Galaxy S8 next week in New York and London. The company is betting that the unveiling and the consumer reception will help it overcome the tainted image caused by the faulty phablets. Industry watchers expect the Galaxy S8 will boast top-notch technologies including an iris scanner and an artificial-intelligence program, along with other attractive features that can raise its user experience to the next level. Apparently taking the Galaxy Note 7 into consideration, industry sources said the Galaxy S8 will also come with a smaller yet "safer" battery capacity. Samsung, which released more teasers this week, plans to display the new smartphone at 4,000 locations throughout its home market starting April 1. This can generate considerable positive publicity for the flagship device. ... Independent smartphone retailers here also kicked off their own promotions with free gifts including laptops or plane tickets, as a rising number of South Koreans are keeping close eyes on the first flagship to be released from Samsung since the battery crisis. "We are being cautious since if we reveal our marketing strategies too early, other rivals may follow suit," an official at a local mobile carrier said. "The very few people who actually saw the Galaxy S8 in advance said the device has removed the home button at the bottom, and minimized the overall front bezel," another source said, claiming some would want to buy the new smartphone just for the design. "We expect demand for the device will be high from the start, and we are focusing efforts to secure enough supplies," the official added.

      <td>The 8 most important features of Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 phone￼ Samsung may still be trying to make up for its debilitating hardware nightmare, but it has one distinct advantage it’s launching its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, early enough in the year that it gets to help establish a new standard for what a 2017 premium smartphone should be. One analyst even went as far as calling yesterday’s S8 event the launch of the “smartphone innovation Super Cycle.” If you believe that to be true, then that means the features of the new phone are some of the most innovative and important ones to date. Below are some of the key features of the Galaxy S8 phone that are likely to be the most talked-about, tested, and even copied over the next several months. We can’t say for sure whether these are the best features of the phone, because we haven’t had the chance to use it for an extended time period. But these are definitely the ones that make it stand out. Your move, Apple. INFINITY DISPLAY The Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch display crammed into what feels like a normal-sized phone, with a barely-there bezel. That alone is a feat of engineering, but the phone is also a thing of beauty to look at. It has a clean, unbranded face; a bright, fluid-looking display; and a mirror-like glass back. ... By the way, if you still want an actual phablet: there’s a version with a 6.2-inch display, too. FORCE TOUCH Okay, Samsung isn’t calling it “Force Touch”; that’s Apple’s jam. But this new Galaxy S8 phone does incorporate a similar mechanism into the bottom half of it, which means that when you press on the (now entirely virtual) home button, it gives haptic feedback in response. Also! This phone doesn’t have a physical home button. ... It’s too soon to tell whether this placement is ill-advised. BETTER SELFIE CAMERA Samsung was uncharacteristically... subdued when it came to the Galaxy S8’s photo-snapping capabilities, but that might be because the biggest change was made to the front-facing camera, not the rear camera. The selfie camera now captures 8-megapixel photos with an f/1.7 lens, and also has autofocus capabilities. In our brief tests of the front-facing camera, autofocus worked well and fast. ... That’s where Samsung’s DeX comes in, short for “Desktop Experience.” DeX is a plastic bowl-like stand with a USB-C prong, a couple of ports, and a fan. It supports the Galaxy S8 and effectively gives you a PC-like mobile desktop on a display. Some apps are even optimized for the experience; although, the only browser it runs right now is Samsung’s own “Internet” browser. Is this the Road Warrior dream finally realized? ... So I appreciate that a manufacturer like Samsung can try to move the needle forward in all kinds of ways (No more bezels! Face scanning! Bye, home button!), and yet still keep that little hole in the bottom of its phone. Okay, arguably, the fact that the phone supports Bluetooth 5 is more notable. But in my humble opinion, the 3.5mm headphone jack is still one of the most welcome features of the Galaxy S8. Well, that and... A NON-EXPLODING BATTERY (WE HOPE) It’s the elephant in the room: can Samsung recover from the Note 7?</td>

To further confuse this situation, there is talk by at least one source that says that the newest type of card "UFS 2.1" is accepted by the S8/S8+!! However, the UFS 2.1 card was announced last summer to great fanfare by Samsung and still not yet available. ... Unless, of course, that this source is wrong: ...

      <td>The Galaxy S8 could be stupid fast on certain LTE networks We now have documented proof that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is more than just fast — it’s like, gigabit fast. T-Mobile dropped a video showing the brand new Samsung flagship being put through its paces on the carrier’s LTE network in its Bellevue, Washington research lab. The phone is able to hit some impressive download speeds, flirting with the gigabit barrier. SEE ALSO: Samsung has a ghastly cover for you to uglify your Galaxy S8 OK, there’s a big caveat here: the test was conducted under lab-controlled conditions. You’ll never have a network connection like that out in the real world — but the potential for that level of speed is still tantalizing.

      <td>A new video from iDeviceHelp appears to demonstrate how easy it is to spoof the Galaxy S8’s facial scanner—a feature Samsung lists on its website under “security.” Hey, at least the S8’s battery won’t catch fire—we hope. Along with a fingerprint sensor and iris scanner, Samsung added a facial-scanning option to the Galaxy S8 that the company claimed wouldn’t be fooled by pictures, which is a common way to defeat facial recognition features. But, as the video clearly shows, it doesn’t take much to bypass. All you need is a clear photo. See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com To be fair, Samsung has already admitted the Galaxy S8’s facial-scanning feature isn’t as secure as a fingerprint or iris scanner. Still, it’s disappointing to see how simple it as for the feature to be fooled. No doubt, a lot of people will use the S8’s facial scanner as their preferred security option simply for its cool factor. Perhaps the feature can be tweaked The phones that appear in the video might not be final, so there’s a chance Samsung could improve the facial-scanning feature by the time the Galaxy S8 launches next month. In any case, if you’re worried about security, you should consider using an alternative method.</td>

You can use a pattern or a pin to secure access to the device or use the fingerprint sensor that’s placed at the back. The handset also has an iris scanner if you’d like to use that and it even supports facial recognition. Samsung highlighted the facial recognition feature during its Galaxy S8 presentation a couple of weeks ago. It’s meant to take the pain out of the unlocking process. You just have to pick up the phone and it instantly does its thing and unlocks the device when it detects the owner. However, it appears that the feature can be fooled by just a photo of the owner. A video is making the rounds online which shows a Galaxy S8′s facial recognition feature being bypassed with a photo of the person it’s supposed to detect. It takes a few tries as the photo is hovered on top of the device but eventually it recognizes the user and unlocks the device. It remains to be seen if Samsung will improve the facial recognition feature’s ability to distinguish between a photo and a real face by the time the handset comes to market.</td>

      <td>So while I can’t really say a ton about performance or the software (beyond it being plain Android with Google apps), I do have some thoughts on the hardware. It is, in short, not what you might expect given the recent trend in Android phones. It’s unapologetically wide and almost blocky compared to the curved Galaxy S8 and the skinny-tall LG G6. That’s not to say it’s phablet-sized, though. Because the bezels are so small on the 5.7-inch screen, it doesn’t feel as massive as it could. ... It feels substantial without being too massive. The back is a glossy ceramic and it feels like glass, honestly, but presumably it’s much more damage resistant. The fingerprint sensor is blessedly simple to reach compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S8, and it’s big enough that it should be an easy target. True to Rubin’s promise, the only ports you’ll find are a USB-C port on the bottom, flanked by a single speaker grille and the microSD nano-SIM tray. Actually, that’s not entirely fair: there is one more port, namely the wireless one on the back.</td>

      <td>The Galaxy S8 is excellent and just saw a price drop actually. And the Note 8 is awesome as well. Both phones are technological beasts and offer the same tech as the iPhone X and a whole lot more for a cheaper price. Not to mention they both come with the fast charger included where it's a separate $80.00 purchase on the iPhone X. And then you have to lug around a power "brick" and converting cable with your iPhone X. The screen on the Galaxy S8 and Note 8 are also better with higher resolution and nearly 2x brighter displays compared to the iPhone X OLED panel. And they don't have a ugly notch that causes weird cropping of videos and pictures. And both Galaxies come with a pair of $100.00 AKG earphones.</td>

      <td>Yesterday's iPhone X announcement got me thinking about aspect ratio, and I realized I have some major knowledge gaps regarding how this all works in Unity; which is especially concerning, given that our (first!) game is near ready for release. Generally speaking, I'm wondering if anyone with a better grasp on this can break down how it all works across multiple devices; the aspect ratio setting in Unity, as well as things like orthographic size, etc. More specifically, though: - I've been working with 2D, 1080p assets; as such, 16:9 (or rather, 9:16 as this is portrait) for this game is more or less locked in. I've had Unity set to a "custom" 9:16, and my builds have looked fine, but i've only tested on 1080p devices. What will happen if I run this build on a taller device, for example, the galaxy s8? Will Unity simply show what's around the assets (e.g. the blue background), will there be black bars, will it stretch, etc? Similarly, what will happen if I build and run on such a device in free-aspect?</td>

      <td>The slimmer bezels around the OLED display are tipped to be the standout feature on this incremental update to the OnePlus 5, which debuted six months ago. OnePlus 5T – Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, October 29, 2017 OnePlus 5T is tipped to be an incremental hardware upgrade on the OnePlus, with a new all-screen design. Play slideshow 1 of 8 OnePlus 5T will purportedly have a similar design, but a larger 18:9 display According to the latest leaked images, OnePlus will shave the bezels around the display to compete with the likes of the LG V30, Galaxy S8, Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X. OnePlus also looks set to use a six-inch display with a 2,160 x 1,080 resolution and 18:9 aspect ratio. That’s a pretty significant upgrade from the OnePlus 5’s 5.5-inch 1080p display. Unfortunately, the new all-screen design looks set to force OnePlus to relocate the fingerprint scanner from the front of the phone.</td>

At first I wanted to make cards swipe-able and have the user swipe one way for comments and the other for repost, but on second glance, that seemed to be a huge departure from the way Instagram works on a core level and I wanted this interface to feel familiar and go back to it’s roots while giving it a facelift at the same time. Images also get the rounded corner treatment to match the cards interface but to also feel at home on the iPhone X, with its rounded corners or the Google Pixel 2XL, or even the Galaxy S8/+/Note 8. The Instagram logo at the top has also been slightly modified to be the original blue color they launched with that was prevalent throughout the entire app. The Feed tab is meant to feel familiar.</td>

<p>From the graph above, we can see that before iphon8 launched, people didn't expect much on the battery life, but after launched, the response to battery life feature were positive. However, for the dual camera, people tended to have lower expectation on this feature, but after iphone 8 launched, negative response to dual camera decrease. Out of expectation, the negative reaction about portrait mode features increased.</p>
